                  When collaborating on projects, it's <em>imperative</em> that all teammates communicate effectively. With many moving parts, if one gear goes missing or is incorrectly sized, the machine doesn't run. I've worked on many teams throughout my career and earned the praise of teammates as well as managers.

              <p>Brad's departure left a major hole on our team- he provided so much knowledge as well as good energy to our team. Brad was exceptionally skilled at communicating complicated technical concepts to users with no technical knowledge. He went out of his way to help educate team members (myself included) and resolve technical issues. He also provided incredible support to our clients and consistently remained in the top tier of our sales. He is one of the most driven people I know. While I was disappointed to lose him (our whole team was sad!) I'm very excited to see what he accomplishes in the future because he really applies himself to everything he does. I know whatever he does in life will being great results. Any company who employs him is lucky to have him.</p>

              After completing the build, my father advised me that the copy cannot be used since it was provided through his existing website service and copyrighted, therefore it was never published.

              Clamour.io, my largest project, is an app created out of interest in the cryptocurrency world. Its purpose is to monitor the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex.com, continuously collect and analyze collected data, and make suggestions on potentially profitable trading opportunities. Dashboard will appear blank if no opportunities exist at a given time. Suggestions are presented in a user interface that updates in real time. Users have the ability to save a suggested coin so that its performance can be checked upon at a later date.
              Future plans include database integration for user logins, an admin dashboard with controllable settings, and a long-term goal of trade integration.

                  Cryptocurrency trading bot that was developed over the course of several months and many hours of testing and rebuilding.
                  On its best day it has netted me over 15% profit. Mind you, it's highly dependent on market conditions, and on some days its better to give it a rest. The metrics I'm using do minimize bad trading decisions.
                  I've added the bot to my repo as an example of my work for potential employers, and I have removed specific settings in my config file to protect the enormous amount of work that went in to determining the exact conditions needed to make profitable trades. While the repo is public, I request that it not be shared.

                  The Simon project is a recreation of the popular kids' game from the 90s. The game presents a progressive random pattern of buttons to the user, who must repeat the pattern in order to advance. Included are an on/off switch, start button, and strict button, which completely resets the game if the user makes an error.

                  Building a Pomodoro clock was rather simple, so I wanted to focus on design. I found some CSS to create bubbles, and then worked the code to fit what I was looking for. I needed to move the shadowing and highlighting so the lighting was consistent with the size, placement and depth of each bubble.
                  The clock can be set in increments of 1 minute, along with the break timer.
